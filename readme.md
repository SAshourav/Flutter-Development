## 🚀 What Is This?

This repository is not an app — it’s a **Flutter knowledge vault**.  
You'll find `.md` files explaining everything I learn in Flutter, from widgets to dark mode toggles, all with:

- ✅ Code snippets  
- ✅ Clear explanations  
- ✅ Widget trees & use cases  
- ✅ Mini UI diagrams (text-based or image-based)  

> Think of this repo as my personalized **Flutter handbook**.
